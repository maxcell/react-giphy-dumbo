# Giphy Search!


## Questions we should ask ourselves when writing React
- What is the component tree/hierarchy?
- Where does the state(s) live?
- File Structure
- What needs to be a function component vs. what needs to be a class component
- Functions are written differently between function and class components
- Class based components can handle state
- Class based components handle lifecycle methods

## Instructions

You're going to be building out a Gif search using the Giphy API. The URL for
the API is

`http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=YOUR QUERY HERE&api_key=API KEY&rating=g`

![giphy search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/react-async-gif-search-lab/master/async.gif)

On a successful fetch request, you should get back an array of objects, each
containing information about a particular image.

```js
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "gif",
      "id": "l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "slug": "bbc-wildlife-l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "url": "https://giphy.com/gifs/bbc-wildlife-l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "bitly_gif_url": "https://gph.is/2iC32M8",
      "bitly_url": "https://gph.is/2iC32M8",

      ...

      "images": {
        "fixed_height_still": {
          "url": "https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva/200_s.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5b9fa2866168584b51f13892",
          "width": "400",
          "height": "200",
          "size": "55556"
        },
        ...
        "original": {
          "url": "https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5b9fa2866168584b51f13892",
          "width": "480",
          "height": "240",
        }
        ...
      }
    }
    ]
```

**Note:** Notice there are many URL keys on each image object. The first `url`
key, just below `type`, `id`, and `slug` will bring you to the images page on
[giphy.com](giphy.com). We only want the path to the actual image, which found
at `images.original.url`. Using other `url` keys may cause CORS issues.

### Your Components

#### `<App/>`

Your top level component will be the `<App />` component-- no surprises there!
It will be responsible for rendering the `<NavBar />` component (this component
is already provided for you, note the project has bootstrap loaded in) and the
`<GifListContainer />` component

#### `<GifListContainer />`

A container does data fetching and then renders its corresponding sub-component. Thatâ€™s it.

- [Presentational vs Container Componets](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) Dan Abramov

In our app the `<GifListContainer />` will be responsible for fetching the data
from the giphy API, storing the first 3 gifs from the response in its component
**state**, and passing that data down to its child, the `<GifList>` component, as
a prop.

It will also render a `<GifSearch />` component that renders the form.
`<GifListContainer />` should pass down a submit handler function to `<GifSearch />`
as a prop.

#### `<GifList />`

`<GifList />` is a _presentational_ component. It receives data from its props
and renders html given the input data. It can render a top level `<ul>` with
each gif as an `<li>`.

#### `<GifSearch />`

The `<GifSearch />` component will render a form that receives the user input
for the giphy search. The text input should be a _controlled component_ that
stores the value of the input in its component state and renders the DOM
accordingly. The React component is always in charge of what the DOM looks like.

`<GifSearch />` should receive a callback prop from its parent. On a submit
event, it should invoke that callback prop with the value of the text input. It
is this callback function, defined in `<GifListContainer />`, that will actually
query the API with the text the user has entered.
